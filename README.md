Have you ever wanted to be like your favorite anime character? I know I have. Unfortunately, in the real world none of us get sent notebooks that we can use to change the world or jutsus that will summon giant toads. But we can write code that makes us look a little like anime characters! Which is what I sorta did. Hope you like it!
