Have you ever wanted to be like your favorite anime character? I know I have. Unfortunately, in the real world none of us get jutsus that will summon giant toads or get sent notebooks that we can use to change the world. But we can write code that makes us look a little like anime characters! Which is what I tried to do. Hope you like it!
